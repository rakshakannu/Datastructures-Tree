// traversal means printing every node value exactly once
// very important to learn tree traversal

// types

1. breadth first ( or level order )

just traversing from top to bottom considering every level

2. depth first

--inorder ( left root right )
--preorder ( root left right )
--postorder ( left right root )

// using recursion,
-- traverse root
-- traverse left subtree
-- traverse right subtree

doing these three tasks have 3! permutations in which three of them are very famous. In all of those 3 traversals remember that left 
subtree is visited first and then right subtree.
